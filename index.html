      <h3>Remembering the sacrifices</h3>
      <p>In reverence and remembrance,

        We honor the souls who stood tall,
        
        Amidst the shadows of tyranny's fall.
        
        In Jallianwala Bagh, they stood united,
        
        Seeking justice, their voices ignited.
        
        But amidst the cries for freedom's call,
        
        Came the ruthless echoes of oppression's thrall.
        
        Yet in their sacrifice, we find our strength,
        
        Their courage etched in history's length.
        
        To the martyrs of that fateful day,
        
        Your valor lights our freedom's way.
        
        In every heart that beats with liberty's flame,
        
        Resides the echoes of your immortal name.
        
        Forever remembered, forever revered,
        
        Your sacrifice, in our hearts, endeared.
        
      
      </p>
